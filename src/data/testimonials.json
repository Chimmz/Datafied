      "explanation": "My journey into the world of data analysis began about two years ago and having enrolled for the program with two different academies at different times, I gave up each time. I struggled to grasp the concepts and actually thought I was unteachable. Alas, I realized the problem when I joined Datafied. I wasn't unteachable. The problem was the teaching methods used in other programs. With Datafied, concepts are simplified and teachers are ALWAYS available. If you think you have a coconut head, come to Datafied. Our facilitators are patient and they go above and beyond to ensure that students are reached at whatever level they are. With three weekly sessions and constant follow up, they make learning easy and relatable. I have no regrets being with them and I am always eager to recommend them to anyone who cares to know",
